puts a + b

puts a / b

puts a - b 

# it is not working if you use it after a = 7
# floating point number is 1.0, if you don't have . it is rounded

puts 15 % 7
# modulo operator tell you what is left after you put the number 7 in 15 (7*2=14, left 1)

puts 2 ** 2
puts 2 ** 3
# exponent, so 2*2=4 * 2 = 8
